# CSE 158 Assignment 2

A model aimed at predicting upvotes of a given reddit post.

## Description
  
This is an open-ended assignment in which you are expected to write a detailed report documenting your results. Please submit your solution electronically via gradescope, on or before Nov 30 (Tuesday week 10). This assignment is worth 25% of the final grade.

This assignment may be conducted in groups of 1-4 people. Groups of four are allowed, but possibly consider splitting your project into two groups of two unless you have something in mind in which really benefits from four members. The marking scheme is the same regardless of your groupâ€™s size. Make sure to specify the names of all of your group members when submitting. Submissions should be in the form of a written report, which is expected to be at least four pages (double column, 11pt), or roughly 2.5-3 thousand words, plus figures, tables, and equations. See an example template in the lecture slides to get an idea of the length expected.

Examples of datasets and projects that may be of interest in this assignment will be discussed in the lectures, though you may use any dataset you wish (including the ones we used for Assignment 1). For a selection of datasets that I frequently use, see [here](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html).
